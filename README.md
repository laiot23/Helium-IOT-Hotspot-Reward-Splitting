## Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the process for splitting IoT token rewards from Helium Hotspots and transferring them to Solana Wallets. We will be utilizing the SolSplits platform to automate this reward distribution process.

### SolSplits Features

- **Automatic Distribution**: SolSplits automatically divides rewards, allocating 1.5% per transaction.
- **Unlimited Split Contracts**: You can easily create and manage multiple split contracts.
- **Stake Income-Generating NFTs**: This includes integrating income-generating NFTs like Helium IoT hotspots on the SolSplits platform.
- **Automatic Claim and Disbursement**: Rewards are automatically claimed and sent to designated wallets.
- **Scheduled Payouts**: Customize reward payout schedules on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
- **Flexible Split Configurations**: Create templates and stack contracts to suit your unique requirements.

## Integration with Aerial IoT Console

We understand that not all users are familiar with blockchain technology. To provide a seamless experience, we've integrated SolSplits into our Aerial IoT personal console. When a user signs up for an account on the Aerial IoT personal console (https://console.aerialiot.com/), a wallet is automatically generated for them. This wallet serves as the destination for split rewards, eliminating the need for users to navigate the complexities of wallet creation.

### Reward Distribution Process

Here's an overview of the reward distribution process:

1. **Integration of Income-Generating NFTs with SolSplits**: We integrate income-generating NFTs, such as Helium IoT hotspots, into a Solana smart contract through SolSplits. We plan to use the SolSplits SDK for TypeScript (https://github.com/solSplits/solsplits-sdk-ts) to directly integrate the SolSplits infrastructure into the Aerial IoT console via a user-friendly UI.

2. **Reward Distibution**: Users can add all the wallets associated with hotspots that will receive split rewards, along with their specific percentage shares and the frequency of reward distribution (e.g., weekly or monthly).

3. **Wallet Management**: Aerial IoT users have full control over managing and distributing their rewards using their built-in console wallets. They can choose to hold or transfer their accumulated rewards with ease. Advanced users can also send their preferred wallet addresses to the Aerial IoT team without relying solely on the console. When a user signs up for the Aerial IoT user console, they not only benefit from an automatically generated wallet but also have the option to use their IoT sensor via the console.

## Conclusion

The integration of Aerial IoT with SolSplits presents a seamless solution for the distribution of IoT token rewards from Helium Hotspots to users' Solana Wallets. This collaborative effort simplifies the process, enabling users, both new to blockchain technology and seasoned experts, to efficiently manage their rewards.

With the automated reward distribution, user-friendly wallet creation, and the flexibility to customize reward allocation, our integration empowers users to maximize the potential of their income-generating NFTs. Whether you're a novice or an experienced blockchain enthusiast, our platform caters to your unique needs.
